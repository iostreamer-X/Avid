# Avid

Avid uses your GPU threads to simulate the behaviour of your entities. One needs to choose a model for the simulation 
and translate to the Avid instruction set operation codes to perform the simulation. The Java Interface is in work and will create
the op codes for you. All that will be required is to make the model in JAVA/Scala.
